SUMMARY:The Eyrie Vineyards Grand South Block Reserve Vertical Tasting 1
 975-2007
DESCRIPTION:The Eyrie Vineyards is proud to have shared its wines with t
 he world for the past 41 years but there is one thing they've kept to th
 emselves...until now.\n\nThis summer the winery will unveil four decades
  of the legendary Eyrie Vineyards Pinot Noir South Block Reserve at a Gr
 and Vertical Tasting in McMinnville on Thursday\, July 28th. \n\nJust te
 n rows planted in the southern most corner of the Eyrie Vineyard make up
  the South Block\, and since 1975 this exceptional block of vines has ha
 d its own special place in the cellar as well as the history books (it w
 as the 1975 South Block that took honors at back-to-back international t
 astings in France in 1979 and 1980\, putting Oregon wines on the map). W
 ith the exception of a few vintages most of these wines have never been 
 shared with the public.  \n\nOn Thursday\, July 28th Jason Lett and the 
 Eyrie team uncork four decades of South Block (1975-2007) at an unpreced
 ented vertical tasting of every vintage of South Block produced since 19
 75. This event is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity to taste the hi
 story of the Willamette Valley.\n\nAdmission fee: $185\nPlace address: 3

 Pinot Noir back in 1999. Ten years later we decided to honor our 10th an
 niversary with a special bottling from the 2009 vintage. We selected fou
 r barrels from our old vines at Maresh Vineyard in the Dundee Hills for 
 the wine we’ve named “Dix” (promounced “deese”\, as in peace)– French fo
 r “Tenth”. It is ripe\, rich and succulent – the perfect wine for a cele
 bration! (Only 100 cases produced – available only at the winery and on 
 our website\, and scheduled for release the week of September 5th.)\n\nT
 o make our 10th anniversary even more special\, we’ll be tasting a verti
 cal of several vintages of our La Paulée Pinot Noir and bringing a bunch
  of magnums up from the cellar as well! Join us for this festive event –
  12-5pm on Saturday September 17th here in Carlton…\n\nAdmission fee: $1

  dilemmas\, and possible courses of action.\n\nGet answers to common que
 stions\, such as:\n•“When should I culture my wine?”\n•“Do I really have
  to stir the barrel/tank before sampling?”\n•“What is the difference bet
 ween direct culture and filter culture?”\n•“Which analyses should I run

DESCRIPTION:The Kris Orlowski Band is a satisfying listen on many levels
 \, and is among the top Northwest talents. Their sophomore album is sche
 duled for release in April of 2010\, with the proposed tracks revealing 
 the band’s increasing sophistication and style. Orlowski is capably back
 ed by bassist Jason Stiles and drummer Tim Rummerfield. Orlowski’s voice
  has the same qualities as Train lead singer Pat Monahan or John Mayer\,
  and is well suited to the wide variety of song styles the band offers. 
 If you can catch them on one of their 100-plus tour dates throughout the
  region\, it should definitely be toward the top of your to-see list. Ca

SUMMARY:The Terroir of Winter's Hill expressed by 5 Winemakers
DESCRIPTION:Taste wines made by 5 different winemakers using grapes grow
 n in Winter’s Hill Vineyard. $10 tasting fee.\n\nIn addition to making e
 state wines from their vineyard in the Dundee Hills\, Winter's Hill Vine
 yard sells grapes to other wineries in the region.  For the first time\,
  we are bringing those wines and winemakers together for a public tastin
 g.  Compare and enjoy the similarities and differences between the wines
  while nibbling on food pairings selected by the winemakers to accompany
  their wines.\n\nAnne Amie Vineyards makes one of the few single vineyar
 d designated Pinot Gris wines in Oregon\, using fruit from Winter’s Hill
  Vineyard.  Winemaker Thomas Houseman worked with Winter’s Hill fruit at
  a previous winery\, and since coming to Anne Amie he has put his own st
 amp on the wine.  \n\nMatello owner and winemaker Marcus Goodfellow has 
 worked with Winter’s Hill fruit for more than 10 years.  That kind of lo
 ng-term working relationship has tremendous value to both the vineyard a
 nd winery\, as both can learn from each other as they work to improve th
 e quality of the wine.\n\nCottonwood Winery is a boutique winery making 
 wines from several of Oregon’s best vineyards.  Winemaker Aaron Lieberma
 n and Russell Gladhart  of Winter’s Hill worked together at Amity Vineya
 rds in the mid 90’s and have remained friends ever since.   It is a plea
 sure to work together again.\n\nLove and Squalor Wines are made by propr
 ietor Matt Berson.  As an assistant winemaker at several well known Oreg
 on wineries he made wine from vineyards across the Willamette Valley.  T
 hat knowledge serves him today as he blends Pinot Noir for his own label
 .\n\nWinemaker Delphine Gladhart of Winter’s Hill works almost exclusive
 ly with fruit from Winter’s Hill Vineyard.  She is looking forward to ta
 sting the wines that other people have crafted using the same building b
 locks.  \n\nSpecial 5-pack savings!  All five winemakers have selected o
 ne of their wines for inclusion in a special five bottle pack at 15% off
 .

DESCRIPTION:It is the night before Halloween and we are proud to unveil 
 a new masterpiece by one of the world's premiere vintners\, Pierre Pinot
  Noir. He has promised to deliver a beatific new Burgundy. But will the 
 wine soar to new heights with graceful character\, nectar of the gods? O
 r might it sink into pedestrian depths with a soft\, forgettable thud? E
 veryone is anxiously awaiting the arrival of what could prove to be a mi
 raculous new find in the world of wine. Will Sawyer Sauvignon become Pie
 rre's Master Sommelier\, or will his overindulgence in tasting cost him 
 his job? \n\nOnly you can decide the fate of this long awaited libation.
  Now\, esteemed oenologists\, sit back\, uncork\, and prepare to ...Eat\
 , Drink and Be Deadly!\n\nReservations for this event are required. Cost
  is $55 general admission and $40 for Willamette Valley Vineyards Wine C
 lub Members. Cost includes dinner\, show\, and intrigue (wine not includ
 ed). To purchase tickets\, visit our online store at www.wvv.com or call

 e from personal collections to raise funds for Portland's Metropolitan F
 amily Service\, the Classic Wines Auction has evolved into one of the to
 p ten charity wine auctions in the United States according to Wine Spect
 ator magazine\, prompting organizers to form a separate nonprofit entity
  in July 2004. This shift has enabled the event to attract new supporter
 s\, expand its catalog\, increase its fundraising and benefit a greater 
 number of local charities. Proceeds from the event will continue to supp
 ort Metropolitan Family Service\, but its success provides an opportunit

 erized by her hauntingly beautiful vocal ability. Inspired by Tori Amos 
 and Sarah McLaughlin Suzie has been hailed as a truly special talent\; g
 enuinely unique and refreshing. The blissfully melodic accompaniment of 
 The Side Project showcases an adult alternative/pop style. The one bad t
 hing about these performers is they can only play Maryhill once a year!

 out compromising great fruit.\n\nEqually well-known for red and white wi
 ne quality\, they carry a passion and focus for cool climate varieties t
 hat reflect both site and climate in complex\, structured and intensely 
 fruited wines.\n\nThis Prix Fix dinner of five courses begins at 6pm and

 tuity. Reservations are required. Please call 503-538-7970 to save your

SUMMARY:Wine Tasting And Appetizers At WineUp Wine Merchants
DESCRIPTION:Matt From Estelle Imports Will Pouring Obscure Italian Wines
 \nRocca di Tufo &ndash\; Orvieto\nA beautiful little white from the Umbr
 ia region of Italy \, this wine pours a deep straw- gold\, with a crisp 
 nose that also shows an alluring depth\, with notes of nuts and honey ov
 er fat.  A pronounced minerality that is beautifully balanced with a wax
 y lemon-zest finish.  A perfect pair with seafood\, especially shrimp an
 d scallops\, as well as a creamy fettucine Alfredo.\nFattoria Moretto &n
 dash\; Lambrusco Grasparossa del Castelvetro &ldquo\;Amabile&rdquo\;\nTh
 is small estate in the Emilia-Romagna region of more northern Italy prod
 uces several beautifully terroir-driven wines.  The sub-region of Graspa
 rossa del Castelvetro is known for producing some remarkably complex Lam
 bruscos\, and this sweet &ldquo\;Amabile&rdquo\; version is no exception
 .  Sourced from 40 to 50 year old vines\, this organically produced swee
 t frizzante wine is a perfect starter or aperitif\, or even enjoyed ligh
 tly chilled by itself.\nCantina Santa Magdalena &ndash\; &ldquo\;St. Mag
 dalener&rdquo\;\nHailing from the Alto-Adige region of northern Italy\, 
 right on the Austrian border\, this high-altitude (600 M) red is beautif
 ully light\, with a bit of smokiness and a pronounced minerality that de
 fines the Alsatian-style whites of the region. Comprised of 90% Vernatch
  (also known as Schiava) and 10% Lagrein (the dominant red varietal of t
 he region).  This wine pairs beautifully with Speck ham (as well as othe
 r pork products)\, Poultry\, or even lighter pasta dishes.\n La Palazett
 a &ndash\; Sant&rsquo\; Antimo Rosso\nCrafted by one of our top Brunello
  di Montalcino producers\, this elegant rosso offers some of the complex
 ity of the regions wines\, but with more of an easy-drinking accessibili
 ty.  Sant&rsquo\; Antimo is a little-known DOC\, mostly mimicking the Mo
 ntalcino territory.  It was invented to provide a vehicle to the non-ind
 iginous varietals (Cab\, Merlot\, Malbec&hellip\;etc.) that are used in 
 the production of the huge (in style and expense) Super-Tuscan wines.  I
 n this case\, however\, winemaker Flavio Fanti chooses only to work with
  the indigenous grapes Sangiovese and Colorino in this unusual but quaff
 able light red blend.\nPetrilli &ndash\; Cacc&rsquo\;e Mmitte di Lucera 
 DOC &ldquo\;Agramante&rdquo\;\nCacc&rsquo\;e Mmitte is a little known DO
 C just to the north of Puglia\, just north of Italy&rsquo\;s &ldquo\;hee
 l&rdquo\;.  The primary red grape of the region is Nero di Troia\, of wh
 ich about 50% of this unusual red blend is made. The remaining half is c
 omprised of Sangiovese\, Montepulciano\, and a local white varietal call
 ed Bombino Bianco.  Remarkably complex on the nose and palate\, this win
 e is like nothing else under the Italian sun.\nMauro Molino &ndash\; Bar
 olo\nThe Molino estate in Barolo was established in 1952 in the La Morra
  commune. in the southern part of Barolo. Mauro took over for his father
  in 1972 and has been producing world class Barolos ever since.  Straddl
 ing the fence between the old and the new\, Mauro crafts his Barolos wit
 h a deft hand\, making a wine that is traditionally age worthy\, but wit
 h a more modern styled accessibility.  Aged in large Slovenian oak barre
 ls\, this Barolo has a delicate nose of violets\, roasted cherries\, and
  pencil lead\, which segways seamlessly into a balanced and harmonious w
 ine on the palate.\nThe best T.G.I.F. gathering in town\, I gauronteee!!
 !\nThe Wizard of Wine and Wine Up Wine Merchants is opening its doors an
 d bottles to all who can join us every Friday night from 5:00 PM &ndash\
 ; 7:30 PM. Now $5 to taste about 5 different wines and nosh on some tast
 y appetizers.\nEvery Friday we will introduce you to a new guest winemak
 er\, winery staff or wine rep from the surrounding areas. They will glad
 ly pour their wines\, hang out\, groove with us\, answer your questions&
 hellip\;AND (there&rsquo\;s always and AND) if you try something you jus
 t can&rsquo\;t live without they will have bottles available for you to 
 purchase.\nSO&hellip\;grab your friends and coworkers\, head over to Win
 e Up Wine Merchants. Shake the work week off your back in style or get y
 our weekend off to a rockin start\, it&rsquo\;s up to you. Come see what
  we&rsquo\;re all about\, meet the Wiz and have a really unique wine exp

SUMMARY:Artist reception for Sam Roloff
DESCRIPTION:Local Portland artist\, Sam Roloff\, will be in the tasting 
 room to discuss his current show and to share a wonderful glass of Pinot
  Noir with you.  His recent works have been created using custom paints 
 that contain soil samples from throughout the Willamette Valley.  The se
 ries currently on display is based on the Laurelwood soil found at Patto
 n Valley Vineyard\, Lot #3301.  The soil must be collected\, dried and p
 ounded into a fine dust\, sifted through a nylon stocking and then loose
 ly sprinkled on top of a canvas and adhered with spray mount glue.  Laye
 r after layer is adhered and built up to reveal the beautiful color of t
 he natural soil.  This artistic process reveals an original style of oil
  painting created by Sam Roloff.

DESCRIPTION:There are three different locations set up to buy commemorat
 ive wine glasses and check ID's. The glasses are required and are sold f
 or $10.00 each\, the ID bracelets are free (if you're over 21)! Particip
 ants are given maps indicating in which business each winery is located.
  Then\, promptly at 3:00pm the Wine Walk is off and the fun begins! You 
 can follow the map stop-by-stop or go any which way you want to! The eve
 nt lasts for 4 hours. Some of the businesses have live music\, so you ca
 n tap your toe while you taste your wine! Since all the wine must be con
 sumed in the host business\, it's a great time for browsing the stores a
 nd maybe finding a special gift for that special someone or a wonderful 
 souvenir for yourself!\n\n\ncreated by dotCal

 TINE&rsquo\;S WEEKEND WINE & FOOD PAIRINGS\nSip Patton Valley Pinot Noir
  with Figs with Blue Cheese and Honey\; Chickpea Almond Spread\; and Pin
 ot Noir laced Chocolate Truffles\nPrepare to fall in love&hellip\; with 
 Patton Valley Pinot Noir and food tastes perfect for feeding your inner

 and Sunday\, February 12 from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. For more information\, c
 all 503-985-3445.\nValentine&rsquo\;s Weekend Wine Pours\nde-Classified 
 Pinot Noir Not all wine is meant to be serious! This is our playful Pino
 t Noir\, slightly less focused than its overachieving big sister. It tra
 des weight and complexity for a lighter body\, racy acidity\, and bright
  cherry flavors. Perfect with that Tuesday night dinner!\n2009 Patton Va
 lley Pinot Noir This wine is a hedonist's dream\, viscous and silky smoo
 th.  Surprisingly savory aromatics of leather and black tea quickly give
  way to sweeter sensations of fresh baked spice cake and cola.  On the p
 alate\, mixed berries mingle with notes of sweet black cherry and cassis
 .  Luscious fruit\, broad tannins\, beautifully integrated oak and sensa
 tional acidity coalesce to create this balanced and enjoyable wine.\n200
 9 10-Acre Block Pinot Noir Aromatically this wine is a bouquet of chamom
 ile\, spearmint\, lavender\, and earl grey tea.  Upon first taste\, the 
 flowers give way to a sweet berry character and fresh black cherries.  T
 his wine is all finesse\, with a broad mid-palate containing hints of mo
 lasses\, cherry\, currant and flint\, as well as a tamed acidity that pu
 lls through the long\, lingering finish.\n \n2009 Lorna-Marie Pinot Lorn
 a-Marie abounds with the scents of fresh-picked strawberries\, Bing cher
 ries\, rose petals and spiced plum\, with a touch of salty sea air and b
 lack pepper.  On the palate\, the wine shows great weight with a viscous
 \, velvet-like texture\, and layer upon layer of ripe red black fruit fl
 avors.  This wine possesses a striking backbone of acidity\, yet marries
  beautifully with the soft\, creamy tannins\, lingering with astounding 
 length.  Enjoy now or save for 5-12 years.\n \nFoods to Set the Mood\nCh
 ickpea Almond Spread\nAlmond - A symbol of fertility throughout the ages
 . The aroma is thought to induce passion in a female. \nFigs with Blue C
 heese and Honey\nFigs - An open fig is thought to emulate the female sex
  organs and was traditionally thought of as sexual stimulant. A man brea
 king open a fig and eating it in front of his lover is a powerful erotic
  act.\n\nHoney - Many medicines in Egyptian times were based on honey\, 
 including cures for sterility and impotence. Medieval seducers plied the
 ir partners with Mead\, a fermented drink made from honey. Lovers on the
 ir "Honeymoon" drank mead and it was thought to "sweeten" the marriage. 
 \nWhite Bean Truffle Spread\nThe Greeks and the Romans considered the ra
 re Truffle to be an aphrodisiac. The musky scent is said to stimulate an
 d sensitize the skin to touch. \nLorna-Marie laced Honest Chocolate Truf
 fle\nThe Aztecs referred to chocolate "nourishment of the Gods". Chocola
 te contains chemicals thought to effect neurotransmitters in the brain a
 nd a related substance to caffeine called theobromine. Chocolate contain
 s more antioxidant (cancer preventing enzymes) than does red wine.\n\ncr

SUMMARY:Vertical Tasting of Cardiac Hill Pinot Noir\, 2006-2011 @ Kramer
  Vineyards
DESCRIPTION:In honor of American Heart Month\, we are presenting a guide
 d vertical tasting of our Pinot Noirs from the Cardiac Hill block. This 
 is the first in a series of guided vertical tastings of our single-block
  Pinot Noirs. On February 25 and 26\, join vintner Keith Kramer in our c
 ellar for a tasting of the Pinot Noirs from the Cardiac Hill block from 
 2006 to 2011. Experience the effects of vine and bottle age\, the dramat
 ic impact of growing conditions from each vintage\, and discover the qua
 lities that make this block so unique. For this special tasting\, not on
 ly will we feature two barrel samples--2010 and 2011\, but also the 2006
  Pinot Noir\, from the Kramer's wine library.\n\nBlock history: Cardiac 
 Hill was planted in 1995\, and is composed of Pommard and Dijon 115 clon
 es on grafted rootstock with higher vine density (1\,202 vines/acre) tha
 n in the main part of the vineyard (871 vines/acre). Planted on a steep 
 south facing slope with Willakenzie soils\, the vines on this hillside s
 truggled initially. The young vines were stressed for water and nutrient
 s due to the dense clay loam. However\, Trudy and Keith recognized early
  that the fruit from this block was distinctive. In 2005\, ten years aft
 er the block was originally planted\, the vines matured enough to produc
 e a crop large enough for their first bottling of Cardiac Hill Pinot Noi
 r. \n\nThe tasting is February 25 & 26\, 11:00 - 5:00 pm\n$10/person\, $
 5/person for Cellar Door Club Members\n\ncreated by dotCal

DESCRIPTION:Sunday\, July 17\n\nGaea Schell & Scott Steed\n\n\nGaea Sche
 ll is described as “one of the West Coast’s best kept secrets”. She pref
 ers to describe herself as a jazz pianist who also sings\, but the truth
  is that Schell handles both those hyphenates with plenty of style\, ima
 gination and grace" - Don Heckman (The International Review of Music).  
 Known among her peers for swinging every single note\, subtle phrasing\,
  and unique\, lyrical writing\, this Los Angeles-based pianist/composer 
 will give a one time performance at Maryhill. Accomplished and versatile
 \, she - as drummer Albert 'Tootie' Heath says\, "plays the heck out of 
 the piano with them small hands". Gaea has three acclaimed CDs and is cu
 rrently an integral part of the Los Angeles jazz scene.\n\nScott Steed h
 as been playing bass professionally since he was only 12! A native of Mi
 chigan who grew up in San Francisco\, Steed has been a first –call bassi
 st on the west coast for such jazz luminaries as Horace Silver\, Joe Wil
 liams\, Joe Pass and Joe Henderson\; he’s particularly supported numerou
 s vocalists including the great Mark Murphy (with whom he recorded the G
 rammy nominated September Ballads)\, Karrin Allyson\, Rebecca Parrish\, 
 Rebecca Kilgore Nancy King\, and Diane Schuur\, for whom he also serves 
 as Musical Director. With Laura Caviani\, he toured with the 2004 and 20
 05 Concord Jazz Festival.

SUMMARY:Special Burgundy and Champagne Flight!  at Scott Paul Wines
DESCRIPTION:From 12-5 pm today\, we’ll be featuring a flight of the inte
 rnationally renowned wines of Domaine Jean-Marc & Hugues Pavelot  \, fro
 m Savigny-lès-Beaune\, home to some of Burgundy’s greatest values. And o
 f course nothing says love like bubbles\, so we’ll have some micro-produ
 ction grower Champagnes on hand as well.  Scott is a lifelong lover of C
 hampagne and we started importing some hard-to-come-by gems after years 
 of research.  Small-grower Champagne means that the producers use only t
 heir own estate fruit to produce the wine\, their production is small an
 d the wines taste of their specific terroirs — in stark contrast to mass
 -produced Champagne houses that buy fruit from hundreds of growers and p
 roduce hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of cases! Followed by a r
 eservations-only 6-8 pm Champagne Seminar\, taught by winemaker/importer
  Scott Paul Wright. (see separate listing)

SUMMARY:Music Event: The Silent Comedy
DESCRIPTION: \n\n	MUSIC EVENT: THE SILENT COMEDY\n\n	\n		\n			 \n		\n			
 Kick off your Summer with a special acoustic concert at Penner-Ash byThe
  Silent Comedy.  Tasty bites\, created by Feastworks\, and select Penner
 -Ash wines will be available for purchase at the event.\n			Tickets are 
 $40 per person\, limit 4\, and can be purchased at our online store.\n		
 	\n				Band Bio\n			Since 1996\, brothers Jeremiah and Joshua Zimmerman 
 have been fighting an uphill battle to pursue music. That year\, their p
 reacher father sold all of their possessions and launched the family on 
 a worldwide adventure that included travels through Asia\, Russia\, the 
 Middle East\, Europe\, and the entirety of the United States. From playi
 ng folk instruments in the foothills of the Himalayas\, to drawing crowd
 s around pianos at Spanish shopping malls\, the boys kept their musical 
 outlet alive by any means possible. Different elements of this life hist
 ory eventually culminated in the formation of The Silent Comedy ten year
 s later.\n			What started gaining momentum in 2006 as a loose collection
  of musicians\, eventually evolved into a solid quintet of performers wh
 o turn heads for their wild live performance\, genre-bending sound\, and
  unique aesthetic. In 2008\, the group recorded their eponymous debut st
 udio EP with Brian Karscig (producer\, and founding member of Lous XIV &
 ndash\; Atlantic Records). In keeping with their DIY tradition\, the ban
 d self-produced their follow up LP\, Common Faults\, in 2010. The result
 ing buzz from sold-out pressings of both records\, and sold-out shows ar
 ound California\, have resulted in sharing the bill with such diverse pe
 rformers as Mumford and Sons\, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros\, Ra
 zorlight\, Switchfoot\, The Black Keys\, Common\, MGMT\, Cold War Kids\,
  Flogging Molly\, The Whigs\, Delta Spirit\, and more. The band is on to
 ur in support of their newest release\, Cruelty & Clemency (mixed by Bri
 an Malouf).\n		\n	\n\n \n\ncreated by dotCal

SUMMARY:Wine Tasting Sensory Workshop Series: “Know Thy Palate!”
DESCRIPTION:So often we hear folks eschewing the virtues of their own ta
 ste buds\, comments like “I’m not a sophisticated wine drinker”\, etc. Y
 ou are more sophisticated than you think! We are all born with particula
 r DNA that determines a particular set of olfactory bulbs and taste buds
  unique to ourselves. We all experience wine uniquely\, and we love to s
 ee people ENJOY and drink what they like.\n\nWith this in mind\, we have
  decided to start a series of Wine Sensory workshops at AniChe Cellars t
 o help wine enthusiasts better identify their own sensory experience wit
 h wine.\n\nWorkshop “Know Thy Palate!” \nJune 19th\, Sunday at 6 pm to 9
  pm\nWhat kind of taster are you? What are your sensory favorites? What 
 do you look for in food pairing?\n\nAll workshops will include many wine
  samples and food pairing. Reservations required\, limited to 20 people\
 , $20/workshop\, free to wine club members.

DESCRIPTION:\n	Panther Creek Cellars\, located in McMinnville\, Oregon\,
  has been producing ultra-premium Pinot noir since 1986. Our wines are m
 ade from grapes grown at some of Oregon's finest vineyards. Our goal in 
 making Panther Creek wine is simple. We want each wine to express the pe
 rsonality of its vintage and character of its vineyard as clearly as pos
 sible. We believe that this expressiveness is the essence of great Orego
 n Pinot noir.\n\n	\n\n	 \n\n	\n	 \n

DESCRIPTION:This Week Pietro Buttitta From Rosa d'Oro Vineyards  Will Be
  Pouring\n2009 Barbera\n2009 Primotivo\n2009 Sangiovese\nArneis\nMuscat 
 Canelli\n\n	The Winery\nRosa d'Oro Vineyards and winery is owned and ope
 rated by the Buttitta family. We have been growing premium wine grapes i
 n California since 1953. Today we focus on the production of old-world I
 talian wines of the highest quality made from our own sustainably farmed
  vineyards. In the Italian tradition we also produce our own orchard-gro
 wn olive oils and vinegars. We control quality the traditional way\, by 
 performing all of the work\, beginning to end\, ourselves. This is the o
 nly way we believe that quality and character can be made to speak for t
 hemselves.\nIn 1991 we moved to Kelseyville\, in Lake County\, from our 
 Sonoma County vineyards\, and in 1994 we began planting our first vines.
  The rich\, red volcanic soil\, warm daytime temperatures and cold night
 s are perfect for our selection of Italian varietals. The rugged climate
  produces powerful wines of particular character.\nIn 2003 we offered ou
 r 2001 and 2002 wines to the public for the first time. We are expanding
  our production every year and we are currently producing just fewer tha
 n 2000 cases a year. 2004 saw our first production run of estate grown e
 xtra virgin olive oil from our pendolino\, maurino\, frantoio\, leccino\
 , corotina and arbaquena olive trees. The last few years have been very 
 good\, allowing us to open a tasting room to the public in 2005. Our fir
 st bottling of oak aged varietal vine vinegars was released in June 2007
 . Today\, we grow and produce many award winning wines\, including Aglia
 nico\, Barbera\, Dolcetto and Primitivo. We also vint award winning Sang
 iovese and Rosato from locally produced grapes.\nThe best T.G.I.F. gathe
 ring in town\, I gauronteee!!!\nThe Wizard of Wine and Wine Up Wine Merc
 hants is opening its doors and bottles to all who can join us every Frid
 ay night from 5:00 PM &ndash\; 8:00 PM. Now Free to taste about 5 differ
 ent wines and nosh on some tasty appetizers.\nEvery Friday we will intro
 duce you to a new guest winemaker\, winery staff or wine rep from the su
 rrounding areas. They will gladly pour their wines\, hang out\, groove w
 ith us\, answer your questions&hellip\;AND (there&rsquo\;s always and AN
 D) if you try something you just can&rsquo\;t live without they will hav
